		"description": "Married, son of a Northeastern father and a Southern mother, I was born and raised in the West Zone of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. \n It was during high school that the opportunity arose to have the first contact with computers through courses. From then onwards I awakened the passion for technology which led me to training in Information Systems where I had initial experiences with web development. \n After nearly three years of experience in technical support, I embraced the opportunity in a new challenge acting as an administrative analyst in retail trade, in which I performed computer maintenance and managed social networks, among other tasks, and, in parallel, I got freelance experiences in Web Design developing static websites in html and css, posters, banners, flyers, folders and art for religious organizations. \n In order to gain knowledge and experience of new technologies and the market, I sought a new training in Technology in Systems Analysis and Development with the hands-on model in experience in the area of ​​information technology. \n I currently develop web projects (HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery), in addition to knowledge in database (MySQL, Oracle SQL), other languages ​​(Python, Java, PHP), tools (Figma, Node-RED, Eclipse, VSCode) and development methodologies (Scrum, MVC, UML). \n In addition to web development, my passion extends to discovering places linked to nature, animals, culture and music where I play guitar, keyboard and make compositions."
